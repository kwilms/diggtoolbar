The Digg Toolbar for Firefox lets you Digg, submit content, and keep track of Digg even when you're not on the Digg site itself. With a notification window built into the toolbar, you'll never miss a popular story or when friends Digg, submit, or comment on stories.

## Using the Toolbar ##
When you're browsing the web, the toolbar will let you know if a story has already been submitted to Digg and, if it has, how many Diggs and comments it got. If the page you're viewing isn't already on Digg, the toolbar will display a submit button, which will help you easily submit the story to Digg and share it with the entire Digg community. It's even easy to hide the toolbar; if you don't want to see it, simply click on the Digg guy in the navigation bar, and it will be hidden.

## Latest Popular Content ##
The toolbar will alert you when new stories become popular on Digg by showing the story details in a small notification window at the bottom of the browser. And don't worry, you can control whether to see all recently popular stories or just those from the topics and media types you care about.

## Follow Your Friends ##
A great way to discover the best content is to see what your friends are doing on Digg. Enter your Digg username in the settings window to receive notifications when you friends Digg, submit, or comment on stories. To go back and look at earlier notifications, click the Digg icon at the status bar at the bottom of the browser. All notifications can also be snoozed if you want to temporarily turn them off.

## Customize ##
In addition to setting topics for notifications of popular stories and your Digg username for notifications of friends' activity, you can customize the placement of the notification window, how long it displays, and how links should be opened.
